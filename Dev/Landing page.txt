So here's an idea of the landing page:

((pitchdea logo up top))

<h1>WE had an IDEA

<h1>About IDEAS that can change the world

<h2>Come see ours and many more when PITCHDEA.COM launches

(there would be a full page scroll down with forced height and position)

<p>Pitchdea is a Finnish startup that aims to bring the ideas of the world together in a way never seen before.

We are about crowdsourcing, creative thinking, and most of all, about ideas that can change the world.

Come see us when we launch ((in 2014?)), or contact us on Twitter, Facebook or Google+!

((facebook, google+, subscribe, info etc etc))
