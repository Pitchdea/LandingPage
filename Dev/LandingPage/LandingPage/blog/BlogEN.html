		            <strong>Doing what you like.</strong> A few days ago I stopped myself to think about what I like. This is quite important, since I believe that doing what I like never grows tiring. Then why did I feel tired?
At that moment I knew that the answer was simple. I had read a book called Taivas + Helvetti and started questioning my motives and what I am doing. I recognized I had the passion for entrepreneurship flaming inside me but something was standing in front of me. The book suggested that I should leave the work I don’t want to do to others. And that’s actually great. Other people might and WILL like stuff that I won’t. This way everyone gets to do what they want and stuff gets done more efficient than ever.

		            <strong>Doing what makes you and others happy.</strong> I’ve been pondering the gift of giving and come to the conclusion that when you do something good for others you feel good because they are feeling good. Now I don’t ask you to start giving anyone expensive gifts but just your time. Talking gives birth to more talking where silence perpetuates more silence. That is why I would like you to talk and be open with people around you. This week, do something with someone you care. Have a picnic or go bowling and leave your smart phones home.

                    <p>  This is second part of a five part inspiration series. If you missed the first, click  <a href="http://pitchdea.com/blog/BlogEN.html#post7" title="Inspiration part 1" target="_blank">HERE</a>. I am on a quest to find something that inspires me every day.</p> 
                     Today I got inspired by a lot of things, <strong>entrepreneurship, music, craft beer</strong> and <strong>the summer</strong> that’s coming. If you happen to like any of the previously mentioned, this post will not let you down.
                </section>
                <section>
                    I found that all the previously mentioned had one combining factor and that is imagination. With imagination you can make the best about everything around you. Firstly, check out this guy. If you have ten minutes to spare (and let’s face it, you do) feel free to scroll to the beginning of the video for some more hilarity. Oh and make sure to have your speakers too loud.

                Next up is the part where you stop liking me, where we get a bit sentimental for a minute. Think of what you liked as a child, and ask yourself where exactly you found joy from. Remember how you had endless energy and loved life and everyone around you. Sure life brought lemons early on, but you didn’t let it stop you. Your imagination built castles around you, a trip in the forest was an adventure. World was endless.

                    You don’t have that anymore. You don’t have imagination. You think about your next lunch or getting home and... doing nothing. You think about the coffee break and you fear the next morning. You lost your imagination somewhere along the way. But don’t worry, let’s find it again!

                    I also promised to cover something about Entrepreneurship. I am talking about the <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/" title="The Lean Startup homepage" target="_blank">Lean Startup</a>. It is a pretty nice all around methodology by <strong>Eric Ries</strong>. Lean Startup was born to teach everyone how create value for the customer instead of building stuff they don't want.

We are about getting ideas and people (that’s you) together and making something great as a result. I am waiting for your feedback at info@pitchdea.com or in my signature. Would you like some more features or perhaps enhancements to our blog? Or you can just say hi to me.

                    If I could hype something it would be Stadin Panimo, Beer Hunters and Innis&amp;Gunn. The work of many micro breweries is so good languages lack a big enough superlative word to describe them. They produce new extraordinary products full of ingredients and they do it without fear. Much like us they are doing something they love. To name few, Stadin Panimo brews the most amazing barley wine, Beer Hunters has Muflonator and other great beers, but the Mufloni CCCCC took my tonque away. And then there’s Innis & Gunn and their Toasted Oak IPA which is the smoothest experience that will ever touch your lips. Google them and treat yourselves, I will fade out with this next video. Keep hydrated, and find the long lost imagination again! Tapio over and out.

                    <p> This is first part of a five part inspiration series.</p>
                    I am on a quest to find something that inspires me every day. I got the spark from my grandma, who at her eighties is going strong. Born deaf she trains water gymnastics to a small group of hearing people, swims daily and teaches herself to use computer.

                     How many new technologies have you adapted this week? That’s what I thought. How long might it take to understand that moving the mouse on the table moves the cursor on the screen? It took just moments for my grandma. “I can open the deaf association web site and read news here”, her eyes blink with excitement.
                    Living with her modest pension my grandmother always has the energy to be happy. It feels to me like she would naturally find a reason to live each and every day.

                    She follows the world politics and notices things in people that even my young eyes will miss. She has opinions. She is in many ways more in this world than I am, I can only watch in awe. I believe that in the end her never having heard a word, I think she has listened more than I ever have.

                        What would you get inspired about today? I suggest you contact a friend you haven’t been in touch for a while and ask how they are doing. By saying thanks you can make a lot of good happen.

                    The day of the PreGame Expo started sunny. We arrived at the scene early on to participate in the first event, the Best Business Plan Finals where we had been selected. From the top four finalists the business with the idea to resell used clothes in an Instagram like web store won. We wished all the best to the winner and moved on; the day was still young.

                I remember Kristian being really excited. The overall feeling was also great, everyone knew that we had solid stuff to present and we had done a considerable amount of work already. We gathered anxiously around the NY stand and waited for the pitch event to start. When it was time we took our places in front of the famous judges <strong>Niklas Oikia</strong> from KPMG, <strong>Gitta Nirhamo </strong> from Osuuspankki, <strong>Turo Jokinen</strong> from Gothia Financial and sitting among them  <strong>Petteri Koponen</strong> an investor with Supercell. Kerkko’s voice echoed through the hall and so it began. We presented our idea the best we could and needless to say we nailed the pitch. The sweet victory was ours! See our winning pitch below.

                The judges presented more praise and feedback and the most important question: why would you get interested about us. Why, the amount of fun developing ideas of course! We are also having cool stuff coming out. Features like connecting with people who share your interests, finding people to evolve your ideas and easily accessing all the data you will ever want.

The event went great. We are already waiting for the next one at Helsinki. That one will be unforgettable!

                    A lot of people were interested in our plan so it is good to go forward from here.

                    Getting to know the other NY entrepreneurs was the highlight of our trip.
                    There were younger entrepreneurs present who mainly focused on resale.
                    Some of them took action by sharing flyers and going through the stands marketing their idea.
                    We were really surprised by their commitment. To mention some 'IFixed it' and 'Mainostax' were being incredibly active. We raise our hats to them.

                    As a sugar on top we met with the amazing Julja girls.
                    As last year's NY Young Entrepreneurship competition winners they had valuable insight to share with us.

			        In the past month our project really started to span out while more and more possibilities emerged. 
                    Under the increasing work load we felt that our team lacked a bit of marketing professionalism. So naturally we decided to strengthen our ranks.
                    Without further ado we are happy to announce that Pitchdea team has expanded to 5 members...

			            The winter finally came to Finland and courses at university were beginning. I decided to take a part in course where economists and IT experts are brought together. 
			            As it turned out, I found a great project called Pitchdea, the aim of which is to create platform for innovative people to share their ideas and get feedback directly from prospective subscribers. 
			            I thought that it will be a great project and decided to apply for the team!
			            I do believe, that in a team where all members are helping each other’s to reach the goal, everything is possible!
