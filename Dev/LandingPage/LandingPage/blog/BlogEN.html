                    We were privileged to take part in the NY Exhibition in Turku on Thursday.
                    A lot of people were interested in our plan so it is good to go forward from here.

                    Getting to know the other NY entrepreneurs was the highlight of our trip.
                    There were younger entrepreneurs present who mainly focused on resale.
                    Some of them took action by sharing flyers and going through the stands marketing their idea.
                    We were really surprised by their commitment. To mention some 'IFixed it' and 'Mainostax' were being incredibly active. We raise our hats to them.

			        In the past month our project really started to span out while more and more possibilities emerged. 
                    Under the increasing work load we felt that our team lacked a bit of marketing professionalism. So naturally we decided to strengthen our ranks.
                    Without further ado we are happy to announce that Pitchdea team has expanded to 5 members...

			            The winter finally came to Finland and courses at university were beginning. I decided to take a part in course where economists and IT experts are brought together. 
			            As it turned out, I found a great project called Pitchdea, the aim of which is to create platform for innovative people to share their ideas and get feedback directly from prospective subscribers. 
			            I thought that it will be a great project and decided to apply for the team!
			            I do believe, that in a team where all members are helping each other’s to reach the goal, everything is possible!
