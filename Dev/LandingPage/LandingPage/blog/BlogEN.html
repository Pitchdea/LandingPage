                    <p> This is first part of a five part inspiration series.</p>
                    I am on a quest to find something that inspires me every day. I got the spark from my grandma, who at her eighties is going strong. Born deaf she trains water gymnastics to a small group of hearing people, swims daily and teaches herself to use computer.

                     How many new technologies have you adapted this week? That’s what I thought. How long might it take to understand that moving the mouse on the table moves the cursor on the screen? It took just moments for my grandma. “I can open the deaf association web site and read news here”, her eyes blink with excitement.
                    Living with her modest pension my grandmother always has the energy to be happy. It feels to me like she would naturally find a reason to live each and every day.

                    She follows the world politics and notices things in people that even my young eyes will miss. She has opinions. She is in many ways more in this world than I am, I can only watch in awe. I believe that in the end her never having heard a word, I think she has listened more than I ever have.

                        What would you get inspired about today? I suggest you contact a friend you haven’t been in touch for a while and ask how they are doing. By saying thanks you can make a lot of good happen.

                I want to thank everyone for the attention we have gotten the past few days. We have also appeared in entrepreneurship magazine <a href="http://www.y-lehti.fi/uutiset/nayta/9939"

                <section>
                    The day of the PreGame Expo started sunny. We arrived at the scene early on to participate in the first event, the Best Business Plan Finals where we had been selected. From the top four finalists the business with the idea to resell used clothes in an Instagram like web store won. We wished all the best to the winner and moved on; the day was still young.

                I remember Kristian being really excited. The overall feeling was also great, everyone knew that we had solid stuff to present and we had done a considerable amount of work already. We gathered anxiously around the NY stand and waited for the pitch event to start. When it was time we took our places in front of the famous judges <strong>Niklas Oikia</strong> from KPMG, <strong>Gitta Nirhamo </strong> from Osuuspankki, <strong>Turo Jokinen</strong> from Gothia Financial and sitting among them  <strong>Petteri Koponen</strong> an investor with Supercell. Kerkko’s voice echoed through the hall and so it began. We presented our idea the best we could and needless to say we nailed the pitch. The sweet victory was ours! See our winning pitch below.

                The judges presented more praise and feedback and the most important question: why would you get interested about us. Why, the amount of fun developing ideas of course! We are also having cool stuff coming out. Features like connecting with people who share your interests, finding people to evolve your ideas and easily accessing all the data you will ever want.

The event went great. We are already waiting for the next one at Helsinki. That one will be unforgettable!

                    We were privileged to take part in the NY Exhibition in Turku on Thursday.
                    A lot of people were interested in our plan so it is good to go forward from here.

                    Getting to know the other NY entrepreneurs was the highlight of our trip.
                    There were younger entrepreneurs present who mainly focused on resale.
                    Some of them took action by sharing flyers and going through the stands marketing their idea.
                    We were really surprised by their commitment. To mention some 'IFixed it' and 'Mainostax' were being incredibly active. We raise our hats to them.

			        In the past month our project really started to span out while more and more possibilities emerged. 
                    Under the increasing work load we felt that our team lacked a bit of marketing professionalism. So naturally we decided to strengthen our ranks.
                    Without further ado we are happy to announce that Pitchdea team has expanded to 5 members...

			            I thought that it will be a great project and decided to apply for the team!
